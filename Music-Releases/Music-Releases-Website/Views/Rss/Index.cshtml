    <h2>What are RSS Feeds?</h2>
    RSS feeds allow you to see when websites have added new content. This allows us to automatically let you know when new music has been released without you having to visit the websites you have taken the feed from.
    Feeds are also known as RSS. There is some discussion as to what RSS stands for, but most people plump for 'Really Simple Syndication'.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>How do I start using feeds?</h2>
    In general, the first thing you need is something called a news reader. This is a piece of software that checks the feeds and lets you read any new articles that have been added. There are many different versions, some of which are accessed using a browser, and some of which are downloadable applications.
    Browser-based news readers let you catch up with your RSS feed subscriptions from any computer, whereas downloadable applications let you store them on your main computer, in the same way that you either download your e-mail using <strong>Outlook</strong>, or keep it on a web-based service like <strong>Hotmail</strong>.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>How do I get a news reader?</h2>
    There is a range of different news readers available and new versions are appearing all the time.
    Different news readers work on different operating systems, so you will need to choose one that will work with your computer.  Besides those mention above the following are also available.
